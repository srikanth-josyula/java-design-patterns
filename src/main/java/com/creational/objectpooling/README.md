Object Pool Pattern

The Object Pool pattern is a creational design pattern that manages a pool of reusable objects. Instead of creating new objects repeatedly, the pattern allows for the reuse of objects that are no longer in use, improving performance and resource utilization.
Purpose: Manages the reuse of objects that are expensive to create or need to be reused frequently.
Structure:
Object Pool: Manages the pool of reusable objects. It handles the acquisition, reuse, and release of objects.
Reusable Object: The object that is being managed by the pool.
Client: The entity that requests an object from the pool and returns it after use.
This Project Use Case

In this example, we'll create an object pool for managing instances of Product objects. The pool will allow clients to acquire and release Product instances, ensuring efficient resource usage.
Structure:
Object Pool: ProductPool
Reusable Object: Product
Client: ProductObjectPoolController
When to Use Object Pool Pattern

a queue is a common data structure used in implementing an object pool. Queues are particularly suitable for this purpose because they efficiently manage the order in which objects are acquired and released, typically using a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach.

Why Use Queues for Object Pooling?
FIFO Management: Queues are ideal for managing reusable resources in a FIFO manner. The first object to be released back into the pool will be the first one available to be reused.
Thread-Safety: When implementing object pools in a multithreaded environment, thread-safe queues (e.g., ConcurrentLinkedQueue in Java) ensure that multiple threads can safely acquire and release objects without causing race conditions or inconsistent states.
Efficiency: Queues provide an efficient way to manage the lifecycle of objects. Enqueuing and dequeuing operations are generally fast, making them well-suited for performance-critical applications.

Expensive Object Creation: When object creation is resource-intensive or time-consuming, the Object Pool pattern can reduce the overhead by reusing existing objects.
High Frequency of Object Creation: If your application frequently creates and destroys objects, using an object pool can reduce the load on the garbage collector and improve performance.
Limited Resources: When you need to manage a limited number of resources (e.g., database connections, threads), the Object Pool pattern ensures that resources are reused and not wasted.
When Not to Use Object Pool Pattern

Simple or Cheap Object Creation: If object creation is inexpensive and lightweight, the overhead of managing a pool may not be justified.
Limited Reuse: If objects are rarely reused or if they have a short lifespan, the benefits of an object pool may be minimal.
Memory Management Concerns: Managing an object pool requires careful consideration of memory management. If not handled properly, it could lead to memory leaks or other issues.
Use Cases

Database Connection Pooling: The Object Pool pattern is commonly used in database connection pooling, where a limited number of connections are reused across multiple clients.
Thread Pooling: In a multithreaded application, thread pools are used to manage a limited number of threads, allowing them to be reused instead of creating new ones.
Use Cases in Java

JDBC Connection Pooling: JDBC connection pooling is a well-known example where a pool of database connections is maintained and reused, significantly improving database performance.
Java Thread Pools (java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService): The Java ExecutorService uses thread pools to manage and reuse threads, improving the efficiency of concurrent tasks.
