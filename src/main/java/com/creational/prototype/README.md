# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when creating a new instance of an object is costly or complex.
* **Purpose:** To create new objects by copying an existing prototype, avoiding the overhead of initializing new objects from scratch.
* Structure:
  - Prototype: Defines an interface for cloning itself.
  - Concrete Prototype: Implements the cloning operation, providing a way to create a copy of itself.
  - Client: Uses the prototype to create new objects by cloning.


## When to Use Prototype Pattern
* Costly Object Creation: When creating a new object is expensive or complex, and copying an existing object is more efficient.
* Complex Object Initialization: When objects require complex initialization or configuration, and you need to create copies of these objects with different settings.
* Dynamic Configuration: When you need to create objects with different configurations at runtime, using prototypes can simplify this process.

## When Not to Use Prototype Pattern
* Simple Objects: When objects are simple and their creation does not involve significant overhead or complexity.
* Overhead of Cloning: When the cost of cloning objects is higher than creating new ones, or when cloning involves deep copying complex structures.
* Inherent Immutability: When objects are inherently immutable or their state cannot be modified after creation.

## Use Cases
* Object Caching: The Prototype pattern can be used to implement object caching, where a prototype serves as a template for creating new instances.
* Object Pooling: Useful in scenarios where a pool of objects is needed, and objects are copied rather than created from scratch.

## Use Cases in Java
* Java’s Cloneable Interface: Java provides a Cloneable interface that allows objects to be cloned using the clone() method. The Object class implements this interface, and many classes in the Java standard library use it.
* JDK’s java.util.Calendar: The Calendar class in the JDK uses the prototype pattern to create instances of different calendar types, such as Gregorian or Julian calendars.
