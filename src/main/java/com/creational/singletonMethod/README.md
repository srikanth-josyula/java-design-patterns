Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
Purpose: To control the instantiation of a class, ensuring that only one instance exists and providing a way to access that instance.
Structure:
Singleton Class: Contains a private static instance of itself and a private constructor. It provides a public static method to get the instance.
Client: Uses the singleton class to get the unique instance.
This Project Use Case

In this example, we will implement a ProductService class using the Singleton pattern. This service will be used to manage product-related operations and ensure that only one instance of the service exists throughout the application.
Structure:
Singleton Class: ProductService
Client: ProductAbstractFactoryController
When to Use Singleton Pattern

Controlled Access: When you need to control access to a shared resource, such as a configuration or service, and ensure that only one instance is created.
Global Point of Access: When you need a global point of access to the instance and want to avoid multiple instances in the system.
Resource Management: For managing resources such as a database connection pool or configuration settings.
When Not to Use Singleton Pattern

Scalability Issues: In multithreaded or distributed systems, managing a singleton can become complex and may lead to scalability issues.
Testing Challenges: Singletons can make unit testing difficult due to their global state and potential side effects.
Inflexibility: The Singleton pattern can limit the flexibility of your design and make it harder to change the implementation or use multiple instances.
Use Cases

Configuration Management: Singleton pattern is used to manage configuration settings, ensuring that the configuration is consistent across the application.
Logging Services: A logging service can be implemented as a singleton to ensure that all parts of an application use the same logging mechanism and configuration.
Use Cases in Java

Runtime (java.lang.Runtime): The Runtime class in Java follows the Singleton pattern. The getRuntime() method provides access to the singleton instance of the Runtime class.
Spring Framework: Spring's ApplicationContext can be configured as a singleton bean, ensuring that only one instance of the application context exists in the application.
