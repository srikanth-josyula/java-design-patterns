# Java Design Patterns
Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems.

## Creational Patterns
* **Factory Method Pattern:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
* **Abstract Factory Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
* **Prototype Pattern:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object (prototype) rather than creating new instances from scratch.
* **Builder Pattern:** Constructs a complex object step by step. Allows for more readable code and construction of different representations.
* **Object Pool Pattern:** Manages a pool of reusable objects. It is used to manage expensive-to-create objects in scenarios where the number of instances in use at any one time is low.
